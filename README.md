In support of the Myanmar Mother and Child Cash Transfer programme
evaluation, this package has been developed to support the handling,
processing, analysis of data collected for the study. The package
includes functions to retrieve data from the online server database, to
appropriately structure datasets, to check and clean data, to recode
data to respective indicator sets, to estimate indicators and to perform
appropriate comparative analysis specified by the analysis.

This package has been developed for use with [R language for statistical
computing](https://cran.r-project.org). R can be downloaded freely from
[here](https://cran.r-project.org) and installed on Windows, MacOs and
various Linux distributions. Guidance and support in installing R is
available from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org).

## Installation

Once you have installed R on your system, you can install
`myanmarMCCTdata` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/validmeasures/myanmarMCCTdata) with the
following commands in R:

``` r
if(!require(remotes) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("validmeasures/myanmarMCCTdata")
```

## Usage

The `myanmarMCCTdata` package includes the following families of
functions: 1) data retrieval and handling functions; 2) data cleaning
functions; 3) data manipulation and structuring functions; 4) data
recoding functions; and, 5) data analysis functions.

### Data retrieval and handling functions

Data collected for the Myanmar MCCT Programme Evaluation is stored in an
ODK Aggregate server hosted via [ONA](https://ona.io). Access to this
server and to the data stored is restricted to those with explicit
permissions and require a `username` and `password`.

Those with access can retrieve the Myanmar MCCT Programme Evaluation
data from within R without having to manually download the data from the
ONA server. This is facilitated by the `get_mcct_data()` function
included in this package. To use this function, one requires the
following information:

1.  **form ID** - form/s are given unique identifiers. For the Myanmar
    MCCT Programme Evaluation, each survey form developed in ODK was
    given either of these unique identifiers:
    
      - `baseline_mcct_final` - main survey form
      - `baseline_mcct_anthro_final` - child and mother anthropometry
        form
      - `baseline_townshipprofile_final` - township profile form
      - `baseline_villprofile_final` - village profile form

2.  **username** - this is the ODK Aggregate username for the
    person/organisation with permission to access and retrieve data from
    the server.

3.  **password** - this is the corresponding ODK password for the
    person/organisation with permission to access and retrieve data from
    the server.

4.  **starting date and end date** - Depending on whether you want to
    retrieve all the data or just part of the data, you will have to
    specify the starting date of the survey and the end date of the
    survey. If the data collection is still on-going, you may opt not to
    specify an end date and the current date will be used.

Given these, data for the main form of the Myanmar MCCT Programme
Evaluation can be retrieved via the following commands in R:

``` r
surveyData <- get_mcct_data(id = "baseline_mcct_final",
                            start = "2019-08-06",
                            username = "ENTER_USERNAME_HERE",
                            password = "ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE")
```

A similar command is used to retrieve the data from the other forms used
in the Myanmar MCCT Programme Evaluation:

``` r
surveyData <- get_mcct_data(id = "baseline_mcct_anthro_final",
                            start = "2019-08-06",
                            username = "ENTER_USERNAME_HERE",
                            password = "ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE")
```

It should be noted that the commands above only retrieves the non-repeat
components of the specified forms. If these forms have repeat
components, these repeat components can be retrieved as well by
specifying the argument `rep` as TRUE and then indicating the name/s of
the repeating component/s in the argument `rep.names` as follows:

``` r
surveyData <- get_mcct_data(id = "baseline_mcct_final",
                            start = "2019-08-06",
                            username = "ENTER_USERNAME_HERE",
                            password = "ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE",
                            rep = TRUE,
                            rep.name = "grp_hh")
```

In the command above, it is asking for the main form to be retrieved
along with the repeat component with a name `grp_hh`. The resulting
object is a list of two data.frames. The first is the data.frame for the
main form and the second is the data.frame for the repeat component
named `grp_hh`.

In the case of the Myanmar MCCT Programme Evaluation, there are multiple
repeats within the main form (`baseline_mcct_final`), the anthropometric
form (`baseline_mcct_anthro_final`) and the village profile form
(`baseline_villprofile_final`). To retrieve all these forms including
their respective repeats, the following commands can be used:

``` r
## List the various repeat names in baseline_mcct_final
rep.names <- c("grp_hh",              ## HH members dataset
               "support_gov_rep",     ## HH dataset
               "support_ngo_rep",     ## HH dataset
               "support_cso_rep",     ## HH dateset
               "support_ro_rep",      ## HH dataset
               "support_ho_rep",      ## HH dataset
               "support_orgoth_rep",  ## HH dataset
               "child_vc_rep",        ## Vaccination and child illness dataset
               "grp_q2_5_to_q2_7",    ## IYCF dataset
               "ancnow_rep",          ## ANC dataset
               "ancpast_rep")         ## ANC dataset

## Retrieve data and the repeats
surveyData <- get_mcct_data(id = "baseline_mcct_final",
                            start = "2019-08-06",
                            username = "ENTER_USERNAME_HERE",
                            password = "ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE",
                            filename = "main_form",
                            rep = TRUE,
                            rep.name = rep.names)

## List the various repeat names in baseline_mcct_anthro_final
rep.names <- c("grp_family",
               "grp_hh",
               "childanthro_rep",
               "mom_anthro_rep")

## Retrieve anthro datasets and the repeats
anthroData <- get_mcct_data(id = "baseline_mcct_anthro_final",
                            start = "2019-08-06",
                            username = "ENTER_USERNAME_HERE",
                            password = "ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE",
                            filename = "anthro_form",
                            rep = TRUE,
                            rep.name = rep.names)

## List the various repeat names in baseline_villprofile_final
rep.names <- c("respondent_rpt",
               "cbo_yes_grp",
               "credit_rep")

## Retrieve village profile data and the repeats
villageData <- get_mcct_data(id = "baseline_villprofile_final",
                             start = "2019-08-06",
                             username = "ENTER_USERNAME_HERE",
                             password = "ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE",
                             filename = "village_form",
                             rep = TRUE,
                             rep.name = rep.names)
```

### Data cleaning functions

There are two data cleaning functions included in `myanmarMCCTdata`. One
of the functions (`clean_hh()`) applies cleaning algorithm to the
household data which is mainly assignment of unique household
identifiers to each row of data and correction of assignment into the
three area stratifications. The second (`clean_anthro()`) applies
cleaning algorithm to the anthropometric data which again is mainly
assignment of unique household identifiers and correctio of assignment
into the three area stratification. These functions are applied to raw
household data (`hh` dataset in the package) and raw anthropometric data
pulled from the ONA server.

### Data manipulation and structuring functions

Within this family of functions, a further dichotomisation can be
created.

One set of functions creates indicator-specific raw datasets that
contain the necessary variables to report the indicator/s of interest.
This set of function are all prefixed with the verb `create_` usually
followed by the name of the indicator. These functions are:

  - `create_mcct()` - create raw MCCT indicators variables dataset for
    each eligible individual

  - `create_mcct_household()` - create raw MCCT indicators variables
    dataset for each household with at least one eligible household
    member

  - `create_canthro()` - create raw child anthropometric variables
    dataset

  - `create_manthro()` - create raw maternal anthropometric variables
    dataset

  - `create_iycf()` - create raw IYCF indicators variables dataset

  - `create_anc()` - create raw ANC indicators variables dataset

  - `create_chealth()` - create raw child health indicators variables
    dataset

  - `create_ppi()` - create raw PPI indicators variables dataset

The second set of functions within this family of functions includes
utility functions used in the data analysis functions and performs
manipulation and structuring of raw datasets in preparation for data
analysis. These function perform splitting of datasets in to quintiles
(`split_to_quintiles()`) and calculation of sample sizes per indicator
(`get_n()`, `get_n_area()` and `get_n_wealth()`).

### Data recoding functions

Once raw data is cleaned and re-structured, it is now ready for
recoding. Recoding functions transforms the raw datasets variables into
indicator-specific variables based on standard indicator definitions.
These functions are all prefixed by the verb `recode_` followed by
either the name of the variable or the name of the indicator it is
recoding. For indicators with complex definitions requiring
multi-variable recoding, multiple recode functions are available for
each layer or step of the indicator definitions.

### Data analysis functions

Recoded indicator datasets can now be used for data analysis. There are
two main data analysis functions that apply the complex sample analysis
required for this type of study. These functions are:

1.  `create_weighted_table()` - performs Taylor linearised deviation to
    the recoded indicator dataset and then returns a table of indicator
    results with sample sizes, indicator estimate, 95% confidence
    interval and standard error for each of the area stratification
    (urban, rural, hard-to-reach and total) and each of the wealth
    quintiles.

2.  `create_weighted_anthro()` - performs Taylor linearised deviation to
    the recoded indicator dataset and then returns a table of indicator
    results with sample sizes, indicator estimate, 95% confidence
    interval and standard error for each of the area stratification
    (urban, rural, hard-to-reach and total).

## Datasets

The `myanmarMCCTdata` package also comes with various datasets produced
by the study. These datasets can be grouped into two sets.

One set of data are the raw datasets retrieved from the ONA server.
There are 10 of these datasets included in the package and can be called
in R via their data object names. See
[Reference](https://validmeasures.org/myanmarMCCTdata/reference/index.html#section-datasets)
for the object names and descriptions of these datasets.

The second set of data are the results datasets produced following data
analysis. There are 22 of these results datasets included in the package
and can be called in R via their data object names. See
[Reference](https://validmeasures.org/myanmarMCCTdata/reference/index.html#section-results)
for the object names and descriptions of these results datasets.
